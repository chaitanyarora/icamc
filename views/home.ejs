        <h1>About The Conference</h1>
        <p>HMRITM is going to organize an “International Conference on Emerging Applications of Artificial
            Intelligence, Machine Learning and Cybersecurity” (ICAMC-2023) in the month of March 2023.

            ICAMC 2023 is the premier single-track conference for reporting advances in all AI, ML and CS
            aspects, including theory, tools, applications, systems, test-beds and field deployments. The
            conferences focuses on the core science to develop fundamental principles that underpin the
            integration of intelligence, as well as on the development of technologies, tools, architectures and
            infrastructure for building a systems, highlighting the design, implementation, and investigation of
            system. Application domains include (but are not limited to): transportation, energy, water,
            agriculture, medical and assistive technology, sensor and social networks, robotics, smart cities,
            ecology, and supply-chains. Among the relevant research areas are security, control, optimization,
            machine learning, game theory, mechanism design, mobile and cloud computing, model-based design,
            verification, data mining / analytics, signal processing, and human-in-the-loop shared or
            supervisory control.

            The scope of ICAMC 2023 is to provide an international forum to promote, enhance and stimulate
            international research interactions and collaboration in the fields of Computer Science,
            Electronics, Electrical, Healthcare, Information Technology & Management. It will facilitate to
            promote the exchange of ideas among interested researchers, students, industrialist, developers and
            practitioners. This conference will also feature plenary talks, workshops, and parallel technical
            sessions. Selected papers will be published in prestigious book series with ISBN number or Scopus
            indexed journals* or UGC journals.
